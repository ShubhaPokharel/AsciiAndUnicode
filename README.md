# AsciiAndUnicode


## ASCII

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

- It supports english only.

  Ascii language often looks like:

  a = 97

  b = 98

  c = 99

  d = 100


  A = 65

  B = 66

  C = 67


  ## Unicode

  Unicode is universal code.
  
   - It supports all languages like korean, japanese etc.
 
     Note:

     Most website lanuages are based on unicode.


     ## Long, int, and underscores

     By default the numbers are int. To make the number a 'long' number we use 'L' or 'l'.

     Ex: long num = 125873982513979325L;

     To make long numbers readable we often use underscores.

     ### Rules for Underscores

     1 . multiple underscores are aloud

     2. DO NOT put underscores at the beggining of a number or at the end of a number
    
     Ex: _03277525309_

     3. Underscores are not aloud before and after the decimal point.
    
        Ex: 782540425789_._259

    4. Underscores are not aloud before and after constants

        Ex: 4691033610910654_l_


  ## Print vs Println

  We use print and println to print something in java. But they are different.

  - println is used to print and create a new line
 
  - print is used to print but no create a new line
 
    Note: 'ln' is line
